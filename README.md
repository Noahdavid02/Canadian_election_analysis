Analyzing Political tweets using Natural Language Processing Techniques 


Voters and competing parties both voice their ideas on social media outlets throughout election campaigns and elections large amounts of unstructured data are produced. For competing parties and voters, this information is useful.
Considering there is a strong incentive to build models which can predict the sentiment and understand insights at the granular level, we developed a project based on it. The final outcome of the project will be very useful to the canadian political parties's campaigning team, where a group of political strategists understand the sentiment of the people to develop the parties policies.
